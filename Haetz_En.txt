We are the last before light.
Since a star will strike in the trembling height,
since the rising border will fall in an etched black,
because we have reached the terror.
 
So not to know, so not to traverse
from the mouth of the yearning shores of the abyss
our jealous and weary blood treacherous
in its vows and among the generations.

Like a husk over our eyes
a precious world will alight, a world much loved,
and reaching toward it our hands will die.

And the tree beside the misty current,
whose bent branches touched the wave,
will see the light of dawn without us.
