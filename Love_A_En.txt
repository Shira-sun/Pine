I haven't even seen you in a dream
Since we parted. The nights descend
Like heavy clouds onto my slumber.
Stifled and mute. I no longer seek you.

My blood is dry in the sirocco wind.
My heart is humble. And in the golden and azure,
Honey-light morning the morning star
Will no longer gaze on my trembling eyelids.

Only from time to time, with the rain's fall,
During the season when withering smells rise
From the dying earth in the hour of dusk,

Will the memory of your soft'and innocent voice
Rouse my silence with a kind noteâ€”
A message of joy transcending the days.
