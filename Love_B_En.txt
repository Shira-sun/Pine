And there was nothing between us except
The modest brilliance of the early hours In the village street,
And the garden's blossoms, appearing before the fruit,
Which would flower very beautifully into white.

Any why did you laugh so much in that dawn
When I said I would approach and
Pick the delicate rose as a memento
To save between the pages of my book? 

You lifted your arms, remember?
And rocked the apple branch slowly,
And a white rain fell upon my head.

The farm awakened behind your back,
The windows rang with the windâ€”
And there was nothing between us except the light.
